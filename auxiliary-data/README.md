# Auxiliary Data

This folder is used to store additional information and data relevant to the 
COVID-19 modeling efforts. 

The data are organized in multiple sections:

- [Hospitalization](./README.md#hospitalization)
- [Wastewater](./README.md#wastewater)
- [Other Topics of Interest](./README.md#other-topics-of-interest)
- [Locations and Census Data](./README.md#location-and-census-data)
- [Additional Resources](./README.md#additional-resources)
    - [MIDAS Network Curated Archive](./README.md#midas-network-curated-archive)
    
If there any issues, or questions, please feel free to

containing the information to add. 

## Hospitalization

Weekly Hospital Respiratory Data (HRD) Metrics by Jurisdiction from
the [National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Hospital-Respiratory-Data-HRD-Metrics-by-Ju/ua7e-t2fy/about_data) 
are used for incidence hospitalization targets 
However, data reporting was voluntary  from May 2024 to November 2024. As a results, 
during this period some locations had less than 75% hospital reporting. The
observations associated with less than 75% hospital reporting are removed from
the target data.

To complete this gap, we collected information from local state authorities.  When
available these data are aggregate them in the same format as the target data, except from
Arkansas who reported monthly information.

The results will be posted soon in an hospitalization subfolder containing the 
source data, the code to reproduce the results and visualization comparison
with the NHSN data.

## Location and Census Data

The folder [data-locations/](./.) contains two `csv` files:

- [locations.csv](./locations.csv) containing
  the state and national  names, 2 letter abbreviation and fips code as used 
  in the hub. The file also contains the population size. 
- [locations_2022.csv](./locations_2022.csv) 
  contains the population size per age group, state (and national level), from
  2022. Starting 2024, this data are used for the SMH visualizations.
  The data are coming from the US Census Bureau:
  - Annual Estimates of the Civilian Population by Single Year of Age and Sex 
  for the United States and States: April 1, 2020 to July 1, 
  2022: available 
  [here](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-detail.html).
  
  
A python and R script are available to generate the data. 

## Addtional Resources

### MIDAS Network Curated Archive

The MIDAS Network has created a 
[MIDAS Curated Archive of Global Public Health Data](https://midasnetwork.us/midas-archive) 
available via the [MIDAS Catalog](https://midasnetwork.us/catalog) for 
infectious disease modeling research including data and associated rich 
metadata.

To search the MIDAS Curated Archive of Global Public Health Data in the 
Catalog, please select:

- Collection: `"Curated Archive of Global Public Health Data"`
- Topic:
    - Hospitalization: use the topic `"hospital stay dataset"` under 
    "case counts"
    - ED visits: use the topic `"emergency department visit dataset"` under 
    "case counts"
    - Deaths: use the topic `"mortality data"` under "case counts"
    - Cases: use the topic `"case counts"`
    - Vaccination: use the topic `"vaccination administration census"` under
    "control strategy census"
    - Tests and positivity: use the topic `"Diagnostic Tests"` under 
    "case counts"
    - Wastewater: use the topic `"Wastewater"`
    - Variants: use the topic `"variant cases"` under "case counts"
